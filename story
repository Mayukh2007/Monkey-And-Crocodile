There was a monkey who gave Crocodile some fruits. They were great friends. Crocodile's Wife was jealous
about that and told to bring the monkey to her inorder to eat. When the Crocodile refused she pretended 
to feel ill and the doctor came and said that if she eats the monkeys heart only she will be fine again.
The Crocodile went to the monkey and called him on. The crocodile took him on his back.
